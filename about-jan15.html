    <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Fair Use and Copyright:</h2>
    <p class="mb-6">We believe our use of YouTube videos falls within the principles of fair use, a legal doctrine that allows for the limited use of copyrighted material without permission from the copyright holder for purposes such as education, criticism, and commentary.</p>
